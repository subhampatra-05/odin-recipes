    <br>
    <p>Shahi Tukda is a rich and indulgent Mughlai dessert made with deep-fried bread slices soaked in sugar syrup and topped with thickened saffron-flavored milk (rabri), nuts, and sometimes edible silver leaf. The name literally means "royal piece" – and it truly lives up to it with its decadent flavor and texture. It’s often served at festivals or special occasions.</p>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <h5>step 1 : Make the rabri</h5>
        <li>Boil the milk in a wide pan. Lower the heat and simmer, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Keep scraping the sides and add the malai (cream) back to the milk.</li>
        <li>Once reduced to about ⅓, add sugar, saffron milk, cardamom powder, and condensed milk (if using).</li>
        <li>Cook for another 5-10 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.</li>
        
        <h5>step 2 :  Prepare the sugar syrup</h5>
    
        <li>In another pan, combine sugar, water, cardamom, and saffron.</li>
        <li>Boil until it slightly thickens (1-string consistency is not necessary).</li>
        <li>Add rose or kewra water. Turn off the heat.</li>
       
        
    
        <h5>step 3 : Fry the bread</h5>
    
        <li>Cut bread slices into triangles or squares.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee or oil in a pan. Deep fry the bread until golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Place them on paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
        
    
        <h5>step 4 : Assemble the Shahi Tukda</h5>
     
       
        <li>Dip fried bread pieces in warm sugar syrup for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Arrange them on a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Pour rabri generously over the syrup-soaked bread.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped nuts and more saffron (or silver leaf if available).</li>
    </ol>
